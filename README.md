## Features

You can create a new grid of the desired size, minimum being 2 and maximum being 100.

The basic drawing color is black, other colors are red and blue.

You can clear, or use the eraser.

## How to draw

Move your cursor over the grid.

## Known issues

Cannot have access to other colors.

Scrollbar is visible, while it isn't supposed to be.

## Information

Relatively fast project for me, what took more time was the UI design.

I didn't add a color picker because i wanted to keep it as simple as possible.
